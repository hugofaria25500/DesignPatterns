*Problem Scenario:
Imagine you are working on a system that involves creating different types of products for multiple platforms (e.g., Windows and Linux). Each product family includes multiple products, and the behavior of products varies across platforms.

*Solution using Abstract Factory Pattern:

Abstract Factory Interface:
Define an interface or an abstract class that declares a set of creation methods for each type of product in a family.

Concrete Factories:
Create concrete factory classes that implement the abstract factory interface.
Each concrete factory is responsible for creating a family of related products.

Product Interfaces or Abstract Classes:
Define interfaces or abstract classes for each type of product.
Concrete products, specific to a platform, implement these interfaces or extend these abstract classes.

Client:
The client code should use the abstract factory interface to create families of products without specifying their concrete classes.
