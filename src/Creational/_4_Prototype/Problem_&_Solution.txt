*Problem Scenario:
Imagine you are working on a system where you need to create complex objects that are similar but have slight variations. Without the Prototype pattern, you might end up with multiple similar classes or a complex initialization process.

*Solution using Prototype Pattern:

Prototype Interface:
Define an interface or abstract class that declares a method for cloning the object.

Concrete Prototypes:
Create concrete classes that implement the prototype interface.
These classes should implement the cloning method to create a deep copy of the object.

Client:
The client code should create objects by cloning prototypes instead of creating new instances using constructors.

*Conclusion:
Implementing the Prototype Design Pattern results in a more efficient and customizable object creation process.
Clients can create new objects by cloning existing prototypes, avoiding the overhead of repeated complex initialization.
This pattern supports the creation of diverse instances by allowing prototypes to be customized before cloning.
It is particularly useful in scenarios where object creation involves heavy computational or database operations,
as it provides a way to create new instances with reduced overhead. Overall, the Prototype Design Pattern contributes
to a more scalable and performance-conscious codebase.
