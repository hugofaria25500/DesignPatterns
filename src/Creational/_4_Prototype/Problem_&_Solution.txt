*Problem Scenario:
Imagine you are working on a system where you need to create complex objects that are similar but have slight variations. Without the Prototype pattern, you might end up with multiple similar classes or a complex initialization process.

*Solution using Prototype Pattern:

Prototype Interface:
Define an interface or abstract class that declares a method for cloning the object.

Concrete Prototypes:
Create concrete classes that implement the prototype interface.
These classes should implement the cloning method to create a deep copy of the object.

Client:
The client code should create objects by cloning prototypes instead of creating new instances using constructors.
