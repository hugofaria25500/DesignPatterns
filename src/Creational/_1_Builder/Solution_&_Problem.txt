*Problem Scenario:
The Builder Design Pattern addresses the challenge of constructing complex objects with multiple configurations or
optional parameters. In traditional approaches, constructors may have numerous parameters or configurations, leading
to confusion and error-prone instantiation of objects. This violates the principle of keeping constructors simple and
easy to use.

*Solution:
The Builder Design Pattern provides a solution by separating the construction of a complex object from its
representation. It introduces a separate builder class responsible for constructing the object step by step, setting
various configurations or parameters along the way. This allows for a more readable and expressive way to create
objects, especially when dealing with objects that have a large number of optional or configurable features.

*Conclusion:
Implementing the Builder Design Pattern results in code that is more maintainable and understandable,
particularly when dealing with complex object creation. It provides a clear and systematic approach to constructing
objects with various configurations, making the codebase more modular. The pattern also enhances code readability,
as it allows developers to set parameters or configurations in a step-by-step manner, reducing the chances of errors
and improving the overall clarity of the object creation process.
