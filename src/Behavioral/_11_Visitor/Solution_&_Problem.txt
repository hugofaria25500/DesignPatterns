*Problem Scenario:
Imagine you are working on a compiler or abstract syntax tree (AST) for a programming language.
The AST represents the structure of the program and includes various nodes for expressions, statements, and
other language constructs. Now, you need to implement different operations, such as code generation, type checking,
and optimization, on the AST nodes.

Without using the Visitor pattern, you might be tempted to add methods for each operation directly to each
AST node class. However, this approach becomes impractical as the number of operations and node types increases.
Moreover, modifying the AST nodes for every new operation violates the open/closed principle, as you need to modify
existing classes whenever you add a new operation.

*Solution using Visitor Pattern:

Element Interface:
Create an interface, let's call it AstNode, to represent the elements in the AST. This interface declares an accept
method that takes a visitor as an argument.

Concrete Elements (AstExpression, AstStatement, etc.):
Implement concrete classes (AstExpression, AstStatement, etc.) that represent different types of nodes in the AST.
Each concrete class should implement the AstNode interface and provide an implementation for the accept method.

Visitor Interface:
Create a Visitor interface that declares methods for each operation you want to perform on the AST nodes.
For example, visitExpression, visitStatement, etc.

Concrete Visitors (CodeGeneratorVisitor, TypeCheckerVisitor, etc.):
Implement concrete classes (CodeGeneratorVisitor, TypeCheckerVisitor, etc.) that implement the Visitor interface.
Each concrete visitor provides a specific implementation for each operation.

*Conclusion:
The Visitor pattern allows you to separate the operations (concrete visitors) from the elements (AST nodes),
making it easier to add new operations without modifying the existing element classes. It promotes extensibility
and follows the open/closed principle.
