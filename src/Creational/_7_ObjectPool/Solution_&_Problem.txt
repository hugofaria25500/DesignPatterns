*Problem Scenario:
Imagine you have a system that frequently creates and destroys objects of a certain type, and the cost of creating these objects is high. Creating new instances every time they are needed can be inefficient and resource-intensive. An Object Pool can help in situations where reusing existing objects is more efficient than creating new ones.

*Solution using Object Pool Pattern:

Pooled Object:
Create a class representing the object that will be managed by the pool.
Implement methods for resetting the object's state before returning it to the pool.

Object Pool:
Create an object pool class that manages a collection of pooled objects.
Initialize the pool with a predefined number of objects.
Provide methods for acquiring and releasing objects.

*Conclusion:
Implementing the Object Pool Design Pattern offers a more efficient way to manage resources in scenarios where
object creation and destruction are costly operations. By reusing objects from a pool, the pattern reduces the
overhead associated with instantiation and disposal. This is particularly useful in scenarios such as database
connections, thread management, or any situation where the cost of creating objects is a significant concern.
However, it's essential to carefully manage the size of the object pool to balance resource utilization and
memory constraints.
