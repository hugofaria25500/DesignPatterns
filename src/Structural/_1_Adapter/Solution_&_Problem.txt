*Problem Scenario:
Imagine you have an existing class or system (LegacySystem) with a specific interface, and you want to use a new class (NewSystem) that has a different interface. The existing system cannot be easily modified, and you need a way to make the new class compatible with the existing system without changing its code.

*Solution using Adapter Pattern:

Target Interface:
Define an interface (Target) that the client expects and that the adapter will implement.
This represents the desired interface that the client code can work with.

Adaptee Class:
Create a class (Adaptee) that has a different interface than the one expected by the client.
This is the class you want to use in conjunction with the existing system.

Adapter Class:
Create an adapter class that implements the target interface and contains an instance of the adaptee class.
The adapter class translates calls from the target interface to the adaptee's interface.

*CONCLUSION
The Adapter pattern facilitates the integration of new components without modifying existing code.
